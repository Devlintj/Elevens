#Questions:
##1. List all possible plays for the board 5♠ 4♥ 2♦ 6♣ A♠ J♥ K♦ 5♣ 2♠
##Answer: (A,J,L) and (5, 6)
##2. If the deck is empty and the board has three cards left, must they be J, Q, and K? Why or why not?
##Answer: Yes because every other possible pair would have been used and those three are the only three that don't pair up with one other card to equal 11.
##3. Does the game involve any strategy? That is, when more than one play is possible, does it matter which one is chosen? Briefly explain your answer.
##Answer: Yes this game involves strategy because you always need at least one pair to get rid of to advance the game. The best strategy is to remove the 3 pairs as fast as possible and hope for the best.
