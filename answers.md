1. Set the I_AM_DEBUGGING flags to false and GAMES_TO_PLAY to 10. Run the
ElevensSimulation program a few times and record the percentage of games won for each run.
What is the range of win percentages that you saw? Were the percentages fairly consistent, or did they
vary quite a bit?
##Answer:The range of win percentages were fairly consistent. Most of them were 11% but ranged from 9-15%.
2. Increase the number of games to play to 100. Are the win percentages more consistent from run
to run?
##Answer: Yes the numbers were far more closer to 11%
3. Experiment with simulating different numbers of games. How many games do you need to play in
order to get consistent results from run to run?
##Answer: About a thousand games makes it pretty consistent. Also 100,000,000 games makes it super consistent.
