##Question1: Write a static method named flip that simulates a flip of a weighted coin by returning either
###"heads" or "tails" each time it is called. The coin is twice as likely to turn up heads as tails.
###Thus, flip should return "heads" about twice as often as it returns "tails."
##Answer: done.
##Question2: Write a static method named arePermutations that, given two int arrays of the same length but with no duplicate elements, returns true if one array is a permutation of the other (i.e., the arrays differ only in how their contents are arranged). Otherwise, it should return false.
##Answer: done.
##Question3: Suppose that the initial contents of the values array in Shuffler.java are {1, 2, 3, 4}. For what sequence of random integers would the efficient selection shuffle change values to contain {4, 3, 2, 1}?
##Answer: 4 would be swapped with 1, then 3 would be swapped with 2, then finally 3 again would have to be swapped with 4.
