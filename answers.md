#Questions
##1. Discuss the similarities and differences between Elevens, Thirteens, and Tens.
##Answer: The similarities is that the all have cards in a deck and cards on a board. You need to remove cards by summing them up to a specific value. The difference is the number of cards on the board and the sums need to replace cards.
##2. As discussed previously, all of the instance variables are declared in the Board class. But it is the ElevensBoard class that “knows” the board size, and the ranks, suits, and point values of the cards in the deck. How do the Board instance variables get initialized with the ElevensBoard values? What is the exact mechanism?
##Answer: The Board class initializes these instance values, and once the ElevensBoard is created, the values the elevensboard gives the class are put into the board class in that instance.
##3. Now examine the files Board.java, and ElevensBoard.java, found in the Activity8 Starter Code directory. Identify the abstract methods in Board.java. See how these methods are implemented in ElevensBoard. Do they cover all the differences between Elevens, Thirteens, and Tens as discussed in question 1? Why or why not?
##Answer: The abstract methods such as deal, replaceSelected and cardAt methods are all methods that can be used by any single card game. This is because they are vague enough to be filled by the minute changes that each game has.
